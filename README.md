Western University claims it has a ‘barrier-free’ campus however, members of the disabled student population have stated the campus is not as accessible as Western claims, as reported in the Western Gazette. 
Websites and tools offered by Western include gaps, are difficult to use, and often only available with a valid UWO account. 

Campus Accessibility (CA) is a tool that can help in areas where the other resources lack. 
This web application, open to all, allows users to anonymously report accessibility issues around Western’s campus. 
CA’’s main feature is an interactive map that grants users the ability to view all reports for a Western building. Users can also view trends regarding report information. 
Lastly, a neural network trained on report data can be used to predict a potential building’s accessibility severity. We hope that Campus Accessibility can improve the student experience at Western University.
